\subsection{Notable Projects}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Bachelors Project (Ongoing):} \textit{'CMOS VLSI Design'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Complementary metal oxide semiconductor, abbreviated as CMOS 'si:mos', is a technology for constructing integrated circuits. CMOS also allows a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{3rd year Individual Project:} \textit{'Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Annual Inter-University EEE Project Exhibition:} \textit{'Quad-Copter (Drone); MFROBO 1501'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{A Quad-copter, also called a Quadrotor helicopter or quadrotor, is a multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. Quadcopters are classified as rotorcraft, as opposed to fixed-wing aircraft, because their lift is generated by a set of rotors (vertically oriented propellers).
Quadcopter designs also became popular in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) research. With their small size and maneuverability, these quadcopters can be flown indoors as well as outdoors.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{EEE Day 2016:} \textit{'Android Based Obstacle Detector Car Robot'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Now day’s many industries are using robots due to their high level of performance and reliability and which is a great help for human beings. The obstacle avoidance robotics is used for detecting obstacles and avoiding the collision. This is an autonomous robot.
The robot gets the information from surrounding area through mounted sensors on the robot. Some sensing devices used for obstacle detection like bump sensor, infrared sensor, ultrasonic sensor etc. It is low cost and it has high ranging capability.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Individual Lab project:} \textit{'DIY: Center Tap STEP-DOWN Transformer'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{It converts 220 volts into 35 or 12 volts. It is useful for any kind of load which requires 35 or 12 volts. Besides various amplifications are possible with it. It is more efficient from others ready-made Transformer.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Social welfare work:} \textit{'Web For Society'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{During the college life i spent a week completing a public project for Social welfare. It was totally free for society.

We were responsible for the safety and well being of the group of first years during the first week, and during this time I made good friends with all of them.}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{I am a member of a number of university societies. I was also the vice president of the EEE club and co-founder of the Cultural Society. My roles in this included recruiting members, in which during "fresher's fair" we enlisted over 200 new members. This was regarded as very successful, considering other societies averaged around 50. I also appeared in an interview on the university television station, set up a society bank account, and helped organise the events. One of these events was featured in the local newspaper.}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{I am also an avid hiker, having completed the national 3 peaks challenge last summer. Other interest include guitar, which I am self-taught, and home brewing.}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{I am a crazy fan of the Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles. At least each any weekend of a month i will try to join with the unofficial meet-up of the fastest speed-cubers of my country.
My record for a single solve of the 3X3X3 in unofficial competition is 30 seconds.}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{I am a amateur writer. I love to writing poem. My hobby is write something unconsciously which are hard to get, but sometime its be look like as poem. Without any preparation, once upon a day I published a book at Bengali Book Fair "Ekushe Boi mela" 2013 which name is “Operation Pure Smile”. Sometime i wrote poem for publishing to Newspaper, Magazine or Social blog.}

Like to be simple and ordinary.
Trying to be professional as an Electrical and Electronic Engineer and be a good researcher in future.
Love to read books, watching movie, traveling at new place and Cooking new dish.

My hobby is write something unconsciously which are hard to get, but sometime its be look like as poem. Without any preparation, once upon a day I published a book at Bengali Book Fair 2013 which name is “Operation Pure Smile”.

Having some skills in C programming, Python, Auto-CAD, Mat lab, Spice.
Working on Robotics and some Electrical and Electronic based project.
Used to at Windows, Max and Linux environment.

A quit experience in part time job in some Daily Newspaper as a contributor, freelance job in outsourcing on the field of web designing and developing.

Besides as an organizer working in “World Literary Center(Bishwa Sahitta Kendra)”. And as a volunteer working with “Water Aid Bangladesh”.

I am not that guy who always acts like a good boy. Actually I am the best for those who deserve me.
The bad things of my character sometime I act as selfish, hesitant and self-arrogant. I hate who tall a lair and who over acting as jack of all trades.
